- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OrrinGradwell
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in IOT and anything electronic. I'm also a professional Software test analyst and love to find/build new things to aid me in my daily life.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make my home smart by building my own little devices to aid in everyday mundaine tasks as well as Python which forms the backbone of almost everything I am currently building.
- ðŸ“« You are already one step closer to reaching me by the time you read this, but if all else fails, you can just search for me on LinkedIn and DM me there.
